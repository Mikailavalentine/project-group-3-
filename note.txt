hey so, I think that we should use the "Recipe by API-Ninjas" API as it is well rated and is seemingly simple,
I am going to try to hook it up to the front End by start of class wednesday, 
and I also think that we should add an api that allows people to do some kind of rating system


Also the Server.js, and app.js are under development need to be formatted and also the code within may need to be put into other files as to create organization
